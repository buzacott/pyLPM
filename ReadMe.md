# pyLPM: Python lumped prameter model notebook

This notebook has some Python implementations of lumped parameter models that are used
to evaluate age distributions of groundwater and stream flow.

So far only piston-flow, exponential mixing and exponential piston-flow models have
been implemented. Binary mixing models and the like will be added in the future when
I have time.

The implementations are based on the descriptions in the TracerLPM manual (https://ca.water.usgs.gov/user_projects/TracerLPM/,
also on GitHub https://github.com/bcjurgens/TracerLPM).
